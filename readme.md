# PHP RESTful Bible API

I developed this project for some reasons: 
- To study pure PHP without a framework environment
- Study API RESTful standards
- Study automatic tests with PHPUnit
- Study API documentation with open api and swagger
- While also working with something dear to me

You can see the project live at https://php-bible-api.vercel.app/.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0.*
- Composer

## How to use

You can start the project at http://localhost:8000 by running the following commands:

```
composer install
```

```
composer serve
```

The API has only two endpoints, wich are explained in the main page.

## How to add new languages and versions

Coming soon.
